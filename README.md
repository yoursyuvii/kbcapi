# KBC Style Questions API

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple, easy-to-use Flask API that serves general knowledge questions in the style of the popular TV show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' (KBC). This project is designed to be a straightforward backend for quiz applications, hackathons, or educational purposes.

## Live API Link

The API is deployed on Render and is publicly accessible.

**Base URL:** `https://kbc-api.onrender.com`

> **Note:** This API is hosted on Render's free tier. The first request after a period of inactivity may take 30-40 seconds to process as the server wakes up. Subsequent requests will be fast.

## Features

-   Serves random questions from a predefined list.
-   Allows fetching a specific question by its ID.
-   Easily extendable by adding more questions to the `questions.json` file.
-   Lightweight and built with Python and Flask.

## API Endpoints

Here are the available endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description                                       |
